This section in your `README.md` will guide users on how to integrate the bcm2835 library into their CMake projects. Modify as needed to fit the specific requirements or structure of your project.

# Cross-Compilation

To compile your code for the ARM 64 architecture, specifically targeting a Raspberry Pi 3b+, you'll need to set up a cross-compilation environment. Cross-compiling involves using a compiler on your x86-64 architecture to produce binaries that can run on an ARM 64 architecture.

Given your project structure and the use of CMake, here's a general approach you can take:

### 1. Install a Cross-Compiler

You need to install a cross-compiler toolchain for ARM 64. For Raspberry Pi, the toolchain typically includes arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc for 32-bit ARM and aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc for 64-bit ARM. You can install these on Ubuntu-based systems using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install crossbuild-essential-arm64
```

### 2. Configure CMake for Cross-Compilation

Create a toolchain file for CMake. This file instructs CMake on how to use the cross-compiler. Create a file named `raspberrypi3bplus.cmake` in your project directory with the following contents:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

set(CMAKE_SYSROOT /path/to/your/sysroot)

set(tools /path/to/your/arm/toolchain)
set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${tools}/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${tools}/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-g++)

set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH ${tools})
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)
```

Replace `/path/to/your/sysroot` and `/path/to/your/arm/toolchain` with the actual paths of your ARM sysroot and toolchain.

### 3. Modify Your CMakeLists.txt

Ensure your top-level `CMakeLists.txt` and subsequent `CMakeLists.txt` in subdirectories are set up correctly for modular compilation. In the top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, you may want to include directives to incorporate subdirectories, set project-wide settings, etc.

### 4. Run CMake with the Toolchain File

When running CMake, specify the toolchain file:

```bash
cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=raspberrypi3bplus.cmake
```

This command will configure the build system in the `build` directory.

### 5. Build the Project

After configuring with CMake, build the project:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

### 6. Transfer and Test the Binaries

After building, transfer the binaries to your Raspberry Pi 3b+ and test them to ensure they work correctly.

### 7. Modify Your build.sh

You may want to modify your `build.sh` script to automate these steps, especially specifying the toolchain file and building with the correct configuration.

### Notes:

- Ensure the cross-compiler toolchain version is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3b+.
- You might need to adjust paths or settings in the toolchain file based on your specific setup or the Raspberry Pi OS version.
- Testing on the actual Raspberry Pi hardware is crucial to ensure compatibility.

This setup should enable you to cross-compile your project for the Raspberry Pi 3b+ using your existing CMake configuration and directory structure.

Certainly! Below is a README template for setting up a sysroot for cross-compiling projects targeting a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu 20.04. This README assumes you are setting up the sysroot on an Ubuntu 20.04 development machine.

# Setting Up Sysroot for Cross-Compilation

This guide provides instructions on setting up a sysroot for cross-compiling applications to run on a Raspberry Pi with Ubuntu 20.04. The sysroot is a critical part of the cross-compilation process, as it contains the necessary libraries and headers of the target system.

## Prerequisites

- A Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu 20.04.
- SSH access to the Raspberry Pi.
- Sufficient storage space on your development machine for the sysroot.

## Steps to Setup Sysroot

### 1. Create Sysroot Directory

On your development machine, create a directory that will serve as the sysroot. This directory will mirror the file system structure of the Raspberry Pi.

```bash
mkdir ~/raspberrypi-sysroot
```

### 2. Copy Required Files from Raspberry Pi

Use `rsync` to copy the necessary libraries and headers from the Raspberry Pi to your development machine. Ensure you are connected to the same network as the Raspberry Pi and have SSH access.

Copy the `/lib`, `/usr/lib`, and `/usr/include` directories:

```bash
rsync -avz pi@raspberrypi:/lib ~/raspberrypi-sysroot/
rsync -avz pi@raspberrypi:/usr/lib ~/raspberrypi-sysroot/usr/
rsync -avz pi@raspberrypi:/usr/include ~/raspberrypi-sysroot/usr/
```

Replace `pi@raspberrypi` with the actual username and IP address of your Raspberry Pi.

### 3. Set the Sysroot Path in Your Cross-Compilation Toolchain File

In your cross-compilation toolchain file (e.g., `raspberrypi3bplus.cmake`), set the `CMAKE_SYSROOT` variable to the path of the sysroot directory.

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSROOT /home/yourusername/raspberrypi-sysroot)
```

Replace `/home/yourusername/raspberrypi-sysroot` with the actual path to your sysroot directory.

### 4. Verify the Sysroot

After setting up the sysroot, verify that it contains the directories and files that mirror those on the Raspberry Pi. This can be done by checking the contents of the `~/raspberrypi-sysroot` directory.

### 5. Use the Sysroot in Cross-Compilation

When you run CMake for cross-compilation, ensure that the toolchain file with the specified sysroot is used. This will allow CMake to utilize the sysroot for finding the correct libraries and headers for the Raspberry Pi environment.

## Additional Notes

- The sysroot setup is a crucial step in ensuring that your cross-compiled binaries are compatible with the target system.
- Regular updates of the sysroot may be necessary if you update libraries or the operating system on the Raspberry Pi.
- Ensure that the versions of the libraries and tools in the sysroot match those expected by your project.

# Setting Up Cross-Compilation Toolchain for Raspberry Pi

This README provides instructions on setting up a cross-compilation toolchain for building applications for a Raspberry Pi running Ubuntu 20.04. The toolchain allows you to compile your code on an x86 machine (such as a typical Ubuntu 20.04 setup) and produce executables that can run on the ARM architecture of the Raspberry Pi.

## Prerequisites

- A development machine running Ubuntu 20.04.
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands and software compilation.

## Steps to Setup the Toolchain

### 1. Install the ARM Cross-Compiler

The ARM cross-compiler is essential for compiling code that is executable on ARM architecture (used by Raspberry Pi). Install the ARM64 cross-compiler toolchain using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install crossbuild-essential-arm64
```

### 2. Verify Installation

After installation, verify that the ARM cross-compiler is installed correctly. You can check the version of the compiler to ensure it's installed:

```bash
aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc --version
```

### 3. Create a Toolchain File for CMake

Create a CMake toolchain file that specifies the use of this cross-compiler. This file instructs CMake on how to use the cross-compiler for building your project. Create a file named `raspberrypi3bplus.cmake` (or any name you prefer) with the following content:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR aarch64)

# Replace `/path/to/your/sysroot` with the actual path to your sysroot
set(CMAKE_SYSROOT /path/to/your/sysroot)

set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc)
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER aarch64-linux-gnu-g++)

# Specify the search path for programs, libraries, and headers
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)
```

### 4. Use the Toolchain File in Your Project

To use this toolchain file, invoke CMake with the `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` option, pointing it to your toolchain file:

```bash
cmake -Bbuild -H. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/raspberrypi3bplus.cmake
```

Replace `/path/to/raspberrypi3bplus.cmake` with the actual path to your toolchain file.

### 5. Compile Your Project

Run CMake and make to compile your project:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that the sysroot path in the toolchain file matches the sysroot you set up for the Raspberry Pi environment.
- Regularly update the toolchain if newer versions become available to take advantage of improvements and bug fixes.
- Test the compiled binaries on an actual Raspberry Pi to ensure compatibility.
